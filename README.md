# RFM Analysis

A Python-based analysis project that performs RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation on customer sales data. This analysis helps identify and categorize customers based on their purchasing behavior to support targeted marketing and retention strategies.

## What is RFM Analysis?

**RFM** is a data-driven customer segmentation technique that evaluates customers across three dimensions:

- **Recency**: How recently a customer made a purchase
- **Frequency**: How often a customer makes purchases
- **Monetary**: How much money a customer spends
